1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Not being afraid to ask for help. Of course ill take 15-20 mins to try and figure out something on my own but first i give it a good try.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
instagram friends   is probably an array of people you follow and people that follow you

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
theyre built in functions to that allow you to manipulate your array

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is for when you need something down a certain amount of times. we would use it to get that values from an array or without to execute a function a certain amount of times

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
