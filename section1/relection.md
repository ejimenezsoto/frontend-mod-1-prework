## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
 The article was very interesting, I do like to read instructions thoroughly before starting any type of project before actually doing it, so that i already like to do. I want to start viewing learning as a process, I am the type of person to want to reach my end goal as quickly as possible but that way of thinking does not allow for me to soak in as much knowledge.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String - Are words that are attached to a variable
