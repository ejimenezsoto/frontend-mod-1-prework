## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
It felt good to take consistent breaks. I was working on the tweet.js file and i could figure out why my addLike function wasnt working. So it took a break and when i came back i realised that i never logged the outcome after the functions were called hahaha

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)? As crazy as it sounds i felt more aware of code and my processes in it. Its nice to come back after a break and go through the steps again.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object allows you to store keys and values to them.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class Array - because were only storing names
  * List of states and their capitals Object - because we could have a key State and value would be Capital
  * List of things to pack for vacation It could be either honestly. You could have an Array of just items or you
  could make an object say things to pack for clothes car food etc.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow Array its just a list of names
  * List of student names and their cohort Objects - were storing information with the student
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake object still storing infotmation with ingredient
  * All my favorite restaurants Array just a single name

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? Reddit posts  have username, time, body, upvotes , downvotes, comments and threads.  so i could see that being a complex object



1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

i will once we start diving into objects that have arrays of objects
