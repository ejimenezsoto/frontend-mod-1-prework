## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between? I think somewhere in between. I like to continue listening incase my question will be answered but once it strays too far ill start asking a question

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning? I already have some knowledge in making functions and running files. So it wasn't too hard for me.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use. A conditional state is an if statement. If its raining outside ill bring an umbrella  thats a real life conditional statement.  Maybe if a user has returned to their site the website will say welcome back! instead of welcome!

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do. You add else if statement to complete your desired functions

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code? || and &&     or  and

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
None as of right now
